## `whoami`
### :rocket: Engineer

First and foremost my love from computer science started when i was in my middle school and made/coded my first animation on Flash. Though i am a generalist, my speciality is getting PoCs to an MVP and and MVP to a production ready system. 
Few engineering tools i use in my day2day:
- Kubernetes: For cluster management, networking, docker and object storage.
- Python: My goto language for APIs, automation and data engineering.
- React: involuntarity learnt it, can't say I'm a master of it but can work through JS.

### 📊 Data scientist/advocate

My job and hobby's entails looking at data and meta data to make tools, data can be used to tell stories and make better decisions. I am a huge advocate for Open Data and Responsible data science. Another reason i love working [@OpenML](https://openml.org). I used to work in TolaData for data science for Monitoring and analytics for different NGOs. Personally I am looking for more opportunity to contribute to data science for soclial good and climate change.

#### :man_scientist: Researcher

I work as a research @TU/e and work on multiple research project. I like solving real world problems like Machine learning on Dirty datasets, Imbalanced datasets, explainable machine leanring and Human in the loop AI. I enjoy research topics as well like Meta-learning, dataset similarity, metric leanring, AutoML and Neural architecture search. If you would like to collaborate in any of these topics then feel free to contact me 🙃

### 🗣 Communicator

I write blogs and give talks from time to time. These days you can check some of my work on [OpenML blog](https://blog.openml.org/). My usual topics of talks are AutoML, OpenData and Open Science. 

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community builder

I am used to be part of communities and help building communities everywhere i can. I used to be a part of PyData Delhi, I stated PyData Tartu and PyData Heidelberg as well. Currently I am working on building OpenML community. 

### 👨‍🏫 Educator

I have given few workshops and teach [Machine Learning Engineering](https://ml-course.github.io/master/intro.html) course at TU Eindhoven.


Thank you for reading through this profile. I love collaborations, I am especially interested if you have a project which directly contributes positively to society or environment.
