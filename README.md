### Hi there, Pleased to meet youüëã

If you are here its probably because you got redirected here through my twitter or talks :grin:

## `whoami`
### :rocket: Engineer

First and foremost my love from computer science started when i was in my middle school and made/coded my first animation on Flash. Though i am a generalist, my speciality is getting PoCs to an MVP and and MVP to a production ready system. 
I work on OpenML and multiple commercial EU projects like Stairway2AI and AIonDemand. I am involved in architecture design, schema, deployment and development of ML systems on these platform. 
I have worked on standardization of datasets, models and evaluations. 
I have developed OpenML BOOST platform for education for biomedical students for ML course. 
On OpenML I worked on designing the backend and cloud infrastructure. 
Few engineering tools i use in my day2day:
- Kubernetes: For cluster management, networking, docker and object storage.
- Python: My goto language for APIs, automation and data engineering.
- React: involuntarity learnt it, can't say I'm a master of it but can work through JS.



### üìä Data scientist/advocate

My job and hobby's entails looking at data and meta data to make tools, data can be used to tell stories and make better decisions. I am a huge advocate for Open Data and Responsible data science. Another reason i love working [@OpenML](https://openml.org). I used to work in TolaData for data science for Monitoring and analytics for different NGOs. Personally I am looking for more opportunity to contribute to data science for soclial good and climate change.

#### :man_scientist: Researcher

I work as a research @TU/e and work on multiple research project. I like solving real world problems like Machine learning on Dirty datasets, Imbalanced datasets, explainable machine leanring and Human in the loop AI. I enjoy research topics as well like Meta-learning, dataset similarity, metric leanring, AutoML and Neural architecture search. If you would like to collaborate in any of these topics then feel free to contact me üôÉ
My publications can be found on my [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AGBlKsAAAAAJ&hl=en)

### üó£ Communicator

I write blogs and give talks from time to time. These days you can check some of my work on [OpenML blog](https://blog.openml.org/). I love talking about Open data, reproducibility, ML standardization and ML education. 

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Community builder

I am used to be part of communities and help building communities everywhere i can. I used to be a part of PyData Delhi, I stated PyData Tartu and PyData Heidelberg as well. Currently I am working on building OpenML community. 

### üë®‚Äçüè´ Educator

I have given few workshops and taught [Machine Learning Engineering](https://ml-course.github.io/master/intro.html) course at TU Eindhoven. I used to speak often at PyCon conferences before corona. 

Thank you for reading through this profile. I love collaborations, I am especially interested if you have a project which directly contributes positively to society or environment.
